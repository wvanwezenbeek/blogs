Wilma's blogs 

*With a background in scientific publishing, the (university) library and student and educational affairs I am posting here (some of) my past blogs (from my time at TU Delft and the VU Amsterdam, covering 2011-2024) and new inspiration I think it might be worth sharing. I write about #libraries #communities #knowledgeequity #openscience #openaccess #openeducation #connectingtheopens #myownopinion <br>
