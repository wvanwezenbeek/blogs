Wilma's blogs 

I post here some of my observations made during my time as Director General of the KB | National Library of the Netherlands and new inspiration I think might be worth sharing. I have a mixed background in scientific publishing, the (university and now national) library and university student and educational affairs. You will also find (some of) my past blogs (from my time at TU Delft and the VU Amsterdam, covering 2011-2024). I like to write, listen, observe and then see opportunities or connections. <br>
