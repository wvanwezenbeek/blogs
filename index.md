Wilma's blogs 

*With a mixed background in scientific publishing, the (university and now national) library and university student and educational affairs I am posting here (some of) my past blogs (from my time at TU Delft and the VU Amsterdam, covering 2011-2024) and new inspiration I think it might be worth sharing. I like to write, listen, observe and then see opportunities or connections. <br>
