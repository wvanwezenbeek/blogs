title: Starting blog on github

I have been thinking about this for some time now. At the moment I am Captain of Transformation at the Dutch programma Npuls, for the topic Digital Educational Resources.
I have written a few posts the past months which I expect to live for some time at their current place (I list them below). 
Now that I will start my new job, as general director at the KB, the national library, I wondered what to do with my blogposts from TU Delft 
(where I was the head librarian or library director for nine years), and the VU Amsterdam (where I was Director of Student and Educational Affairs for just over three years).
The blogposts I wrote in those periods are not "live" anymore, and of course not all are that good to keep forever, 
but some are or might still be of interest. 
So here my it is a new blog environment, challenging for me because I have to learn to use github and markdown. 
I am sure I will learn my way around it!
