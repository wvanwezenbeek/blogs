My previous blogposts from TU Delft Library (published in a WordPress site) have been archived recently. 
I here use [the link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230402092334/https:/librarian.tudl.tudelft.nl/author/wvanwezenbeek/) I found in the wayback machine. 
If anybody can help me with getting the .XML export from WordPress into Github pages, much appreciated! But for now this will do I guess.
