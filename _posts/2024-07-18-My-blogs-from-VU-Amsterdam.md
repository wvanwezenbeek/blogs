I was Director Student and Educational Affairs at VU Amsterdam from September 2020 to January 2024, and I wrote some blogs during that time, a.o. about being a community university, connecting the worlds of open science and open education, and about knowledge equity. They have now been archived. So I list them here instead in [one pdf file](https://github.com/wvanwezenbeek/github.io/blob/a9e6a341950f626c477ba5605162c0eae6a07fa6/_posts/Blogposts%20VU-Wilma%20van%20Wezenbeek.pdf), where I can link to.
