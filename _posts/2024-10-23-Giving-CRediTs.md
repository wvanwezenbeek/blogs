I have been working as a Director General at the KB for almost two months now. Just too early for an overall reflection, but also already that long that I can say that it feels very good to walk around the building, talk to the colleagues in the KB, and slowly (that is far from finished!) get to know the networks and organizations. 
The KB is the national library of the Netherlands and is there for everyone. We are also really trying to attract younger and different audiences to us than those who traditionally or from our scholarly mission know or visit us. More on that will follow when I have landed a little better. For now, I wanted to share in my own blog environment the two blog posts (five more to come) we are publishing this year to share my introduction to the KB with everyone. 

- [50,000 books, newspapers and magazines a year: the KBâ€™s bridge builders](https://www.kb.nl/en/blogs/50000-books-newspapers-and-magazines-year-kbs-bridge-builders)
- [2 billion digital files: how do we avoid a digital black hole](https://www.kb.nl/en/blogs/2-billion-digital-files-how-do-we-avoid-digital-black-hole)

And, completely against my habit, I don't write these myself; I am interviewing, so asking questions and are learning the subject and getting to know the people. Antoinette Brummelink does the writing (and other colleagues help with image content and content selection; in fact, we need attributes here as well as at [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/)). The internal column (so only readable within the KB) that we publish weekly is largely filled by Juliette Rieff-den Boer (in cocreation with me). So a big thank you to all contributors! 

To be continued!
